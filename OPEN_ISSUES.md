# Open Issues & Exploration

## Backlog
- [ ] Implement detailed view for Journeys in TUI
- [ ] Add interactive filtering for Scenarios
- [ ] Explore integration with `llm` CLI for generating scenarios directly from TUI
- [ ] Add "Discovery Mode" to TUI for interactive SysML interviews

## Exploration
- [ ] Evaluate `ink-table` for better data display
- [ ] Investigate performance of `getProjectStatus` on large repositories
- [ ] Research better patterns for Ink/React state management (Redux vs Context) in CLI apps

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add proper types for `ink-big-text` and `ink-gradient` if missing
- [ ] Refactor `src/lib/status.ts` to be more modular
