# Open Issues & Exploration

## TUI Improvements
- [ ] **Interactive Navigation**: Add keybindings (arrows, enter) to navigate lists in Journeys and Inbox.
- [ ] **Detailed Views**: Create detailed views for individual Journeys and Inbox items.
- [ ] **Filtering**: Add filtering capabilities to Journeys (e.g., show only failing).
- [ ] **Performance**: Optimize data fetching (currently re-fetches on mount?).
- [ ] **Style**: Refine the visual design (colors, borders) to be "delightful".

## Architecture
- [ ] **State Management**: Consider a lightweight state manager if passing props gets too complex.
- [ ] **Testing**: Add component tests for TUI screens using `ink-testing-library`.

## Features
- [ ] **Inbox Integration**: Connect Inbox to actual data source (e.g., failing tests, TODO comments).
- [ ] **Scenario Editor**: Allow editing scenarios directly from the TUI?
